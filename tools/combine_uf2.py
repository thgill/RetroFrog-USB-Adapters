# Layout written to the A (device, USB-C) RP2040's flash + RAM:
#   - A's firmware        (flash, from A.uf2, at 0x10000000)
#   - B's image + header  (flash, from B.bin, at 0x10000000 + B_IMAGE_OFFSET)
#   - flash_b_side relay  (RAM, from flash_b_side.uf2, no_flash)
#
# The RP2040 bootloader writes the flash blocks, then loads + runs the RAM
# relay. The relay reads B's image straight from A's XIP flash (in chunks) and
# writes it to B over SWD — so B's image never has to fit in the relay's RAM.
# This lifts the old limit where B (embedded in the relay's .rodata) had to fit
# in 264 KB of RAM; B can now be as large as the flash budget allows (e.g. with
# BTstack for USB Bluetooth dongle support).
#
# The flash blocks' "total blocks" field is patched larger than the real count
# so the bootloader does not consider the download complete after the flash
# blocks (which would boot A before B is flashed); it stays in BOOTSEL, loads
# the RAM relay, and runs it. (Trick from jfedor2/hid-remapper, MIT.)
